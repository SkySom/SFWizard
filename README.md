A rewrite of multiple tools into one program. Basically what this is, is a combination of the couple of tools I wrote to help save time when configuring Success Factors. The tools themselves were separate pieces that quickly fell apart when needed for something else, and were pretty much useless to anyone who didn't have all the development tools to fix things. As such I've been meaning to get around to putting them together in a way that others can make use of them.
